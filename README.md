# Corofides

You may have guessed but I go by Corofides, and occasionally I do programming stuff, and by occasionally I
 mean as a full time job. Work wise I'm a web developer, app developer, and an occasional Unity developer. Otherwise
 I just do stuff for fun, games, and occasionally in the hope of profit.

### Some other stuff

I own a cat named Virtute, although I end up calling her Virtue most of the time as people seem to get confused
with her name otherwise. I'm trying to get some pet rats to add to my growing menagerie. I also occasionally play guitar,
read, suck at playing video games, and watch YouTube.
